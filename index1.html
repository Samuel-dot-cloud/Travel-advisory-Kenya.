        <p>With 42 different tribes, a myriad of migrant and expat workers, inter-marriages and western influences, Kenya is a melting pot of different cultures just waiting for the right person to experience it all. No matter where you go in the magical country, you will find more than just the indigenous culture of the given area at play. Of course, there are some areas that are more…’metropolitan’ that others, just as there are some areas that are quite literally not fully Kenyan.

            Regardless of your destination within the country, you have a chance to experience a great number of different cultures that will mesmerise you and maybe, tempt you into assimilation. If you want to learn about the culture and traditions of the Kenyans, here are 12 perfect places to experience the best Kenyan culture:</p>

You can also swim with the dolphins in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean (learn a little about life as a dolphin from these intelligent creatures).</span></p>

                                Located in Mombasa, in the coastal region of Kenya, the Fort Jesus was <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">built by the Portuguese between 1593 and 1596, to guard the old port of Mombasa, and served as a place of safety and security for the Portuguese living on the East Coast; it had hostile interested parties who used to live in Mombasa, such as the Omani Arabs, who attacked the fort 1696 1698. Fort Jesus is one of the most outstanding and well preserved examples of 16th century Portuguese military fortification and a landmark in the history of this type of construction.</span></p>
